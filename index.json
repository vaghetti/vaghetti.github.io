[{"content":"I love Wordle. I play it pretty much every single day. I also play the portuguese version immediately afterwards too. It is now part of my morning routine.\nWordle is one of those ideas that just click and immediately have you wishing you were the one to have them. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what Wordle is, just click here and play it. Give it a try, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably like it. It won\u0026rsquo;t take you more than 10 minutes.\nOn a superficial level, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing special about Wordle, every day, you everyone gets a 5 character word, you have to guess what it is. As you try, you get some information about what you got wrong that helps you move towards the correct answer. You only get 6 attempts.\nIt is a very simple core mechanic, any programmer with some frontend knowledge could put together something similar in a few hours.\nWhat makes Wordle special is not the core mechanic itself, but the series of very intelligent decisions that were made around this very simple (but still fun) core mechanic.\nNo ads, no log-in When you first open the Wordle website, you\u0026rsquo;re immediately greeted with a simple text tutorial explaining how to play the game. There are no ads, no login prompt, no attempts to get you to buy skins or donate money. Compare this with something like agar.io or any other .io hyper casual game and you\u0026rsquo;ll see Wordle is truly special in this regard.\nI know, people need to make a living. Games are not hosted for free, specially when they\u0026rsquo;re multiplayer games with loads of players. Wordle was acquired by the New York Times some weeks ago, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect it to stay this way for too long anyway.\nNo ads is just icing on the cake, not having them is more a privilege of a game that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to make money than a true long term differentiator. There are other design decisions that make Wordle truly shine.\nOne word per day There\u0026rsquo;s one new word every day. Everyone gets the same word.\nYou only get to play once, if you try 6 words and fail, Wordle will just give you the answer. There\u0026rsquo;s no point in opening another browser or cleaning your cache to keep trying. No need for an account either. Wordle will ensure you can only try once a day by spoiling you if you fail. You can\u0026rsquo;t tryhard your way into victory.\nIt is simple and elegant. Even when you lose, the game ends on a high note.\nAfter you played the day\u0026rsquo;s word, that\u0026rsquo;s it. You want more but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to come back on the next day.\nHoping users will remember your hyper casual game with an average play time of a couple minutes sounds like a sure way to be quickly forgotten, but wordle gets around this just as elegantly.\nSharing After you finish a Wordle match, you get a share button. If you click it, you don\u0026rsquo;t get a list of supported social media websites or some twitter OAuth prompt. All you get is a message saying \u0026ldquo;Copied results to clipboard\u0026rdquo;. This is what mine for today\u0026rsquo;s puzzle looks like:\nWordle 248 4/6 â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œ ðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œ ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ© This is, again, smart on multiple levels.\nIt communicates how your game went in meaningful detail without spoiling the day\u0026rsquo;s word for people who haven\u0026rsquo;t played it yet. At the same time, people who already played today can immediately look at it and know you were struggling in the same ways, which can be pretty fun and engaging.\nIt also brings players back into the game, but not in an annoying way like Farmville Facebook notifications. Shared Wordle games actively improve your experience by adding a social factor.\nYou can share it anywhere, it is just some emoji and text. There\u0026rsquo;s not even an image or hyperlink. Anywhere you can type, you can share your Wordle game.\nAnd repeat  You play your first Wordle match, you have some fun, but it is short, you want some more but you have to wait, so you move on with your day and forget about it. On the next day, you\u0026rsquo;re scrolling Twitter and someone posts their Wordle score. You remember the game exists, you remember you wanted more. You play it again. If you\u0026rsquo;re so inclined, you share your score as well. Repeat  Do this for a couple of days, and you\u0026rsquo;re hooked. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need Twitter to remind you about Wordle anymore. Some people in my feed play the new word every day after midnight.\nWordle and senior engineers Some people say the biggest difference between an engineer and a senior engineer is not on the code they write, but on the senior engineer ability to figure out ways to not write code.\nWordle is a great example of how this looks like in practice. It avoids loads of complexity at design time, making many features unnecessary and still delivering a superior experience in the end.\nNo login, just give users a satisfying end when they fail. No social media integration, some emojis they can paste anywhere clipboard will do. No ads, make something people like first, figure money out later. Add a tight social media reminders + leave users wanting more loop, and you have a hit.\n","permalink":"https://vaghetti.dev/posts/wordle/","summary":"I love Wordle.

It really feels like every single company is trying to recruit programmers nowadays, and doing whatever they can to get them.\nIâ€™m certainly happy with the current state of affairs, but I canâ€™t help but wonder: How does it end? Things are obviously good for us programmers and we would certainly like for them to stay this way.\nBusiness owners, on the other hand, are not quite happy. You see, no sane CEO is going to issue a press release saying \u0026ldquo;yeah, business is booming, record profits something something, great opportunities for double digit growth in something something Asia, by the way I\u0026rsquo;d be really happy if I could pay less money to my employees\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s just not the kind of thing you say, but everyone kinda knows it is true. The CEO\u0026rsquo;s job is to make as much profit as possible. Higher salaries mean less profit. It\u0026rsquo;s just how the game works.\nSalaries are a matter of supply and demand. Lots of companies trying to hire not-that-many programmers means salaries go up, if it was the other way around, they would go down. So how do the good times end? Either demand for tech workers goes down or supply goes up.\nSupply goes up The markets are doing their thing. Everyone sees tech workers making money and just generally having a good time and they think: \u0026ldquo;Hey that sounds like a good career choice\u0026rdquo;. Every year we get more Computer science graduates. Code bootcamps are also booming.\nBut these are long term changes that are barely making up for the also increasing demand, so I don\u0026rsquo;t see any meaningful change coming from this front at last in the short to medium term.\nDemand goes down This is where I think the most interesting (and faster) changes could happen. Jeff Besos famously said \u0026ldquo;Your margin is my opportunity\u0026rdquo;. Tech worker wages are certainly a massive opportunity right now! There is a lot of money to be made by making products that allow businesses to get things done with less programmers, maybe no programmers at all.\nI know it sounds kind of evil putting it like that, but bear with me.\nDeveloper tooling improvements Developers are expensive. If a new IDE shows up and they can deliver stuff 5% faster, that means you can have 5% less programmers! Of course the IDE has a price, but it is almost certainly cheaper than 5% of a developer.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen that much improvement in developer tooling over the last couple of years, but AI is making some really meaningful progress in this field with things like github copilot. For now it only delivers some smarter auto complete suggestions, not that far in the future we could see AIs finding bugs in our code, or even generating tests.\nNo code / Low code People have been trying this for decades and it never really worked out. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single product that was able to get to any meaningful degree of success running on top of some low code platform.\nBut hey, deep learning was in a similar spot in the 90s and now we have real products that use it and it mostly works. The incentive has never been greater. The more expensive developers get, the more money there is to be made by making them less necessary.\nDecreased investment I think this is the most likely scenario. Much of the demand for programmers right now stems more from expectations of future profits than from profits being currently made.\nMany companies hiring now are unprofitable companies surviving on investor money with the expectation of future profit. If the economic conditions change and investors decide they don\u0026rsquo;t like tech companies anymore, many of them will inevitably close. Less companies hiring also means less demand.\nConclusion This post might have sounded gloomish, at least for programmers, but honestly I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s that much to worry about. Even if we enter some new dotcom bubble and a good chunk of our startup ecosystem dies off, demand for tech is spreading across all industries, businesses everywhere are digitizing their operations and these systems will need to be maintained somehow.\nAlso, salaries are notoriously sticky, so instead of a salary reduction we could see a workforce reduction instead. Maybe it is better to start replying to the linkedin recruiter spam just in case?\n","permalink":"https://vaghetti.dev/posts/times-are-great/","summary":"It is a good time to be in tech right now: soaring salaries, daily LinkedIn recruiter spam, people bootcamping their way into career switches to tech, remote work allowing you to work for a major tech company making triple digit salaries from the beach.
